Instructions for how to compile and run the software:

Using a WPF Application 

A.	Becoming Aware of the Fundamentals of WPF

WPF Is a Windows desktop client application for user interface foundation. It divides the user interface (UI) from business logic and offers a standardized programming model for creating apps.

B.	Configuring Your Workspace for Development

Set up Visual Studio, the IDE that is suggested for WPF development. Do not forget to factor in the workload for.NET desktop development.

Install.NET SDK: Make sure you have installed the most recent version of the.NET SDK.

C.	Starting a new WPF Project

1.	Create a new project choose Console App (.Net Framework) then click “NEXT.”

2.	Label the project however you wish to, remember the location where you are going to be placing this project as it will help you later when you are looking to zip the file and submit. Once you are done click “NEXT.”

3.	After you click “NEXT” you be on a screen like this where you start creating the code that you wish to execute for your WPF Project

4.	Once you are satisfied with your code, click the start button to evaluate it. If there are any errors, the system will indicate their locations and provide guidance on how to fix them, helping you achieve a successful compilation.

D.	Structure of the Project
•	Your application's primary window is called MainWindow.xaml. It includes your UI's XAML markup.
•	The code-behind file for MainWindow.xaml is MainWindow.xaml.cs. Along with other logic, it includes the event handlers.
•	App.xaml: Specifies settings and resources at the application level.
•	App.xaml.cs is App.xaml's code-behind file. It has the logic for the application's initialization.

E.	UI Design
•	Extended Application Markup Language, or XAML, is used to specify the UI elements and how they are arranged.
•	Toolbox: In Visual Studio, you can move controls (such as text boxes and buttons) across the design surface by dragging and dropping them from the Toolbox.
•	Properties Window: Adjust UI element properties.

F.	Building the Code-Inside
•	Event Handlers: To react to user actions (such as button clicks), write event handlers in the code-behind files.
•	Data Binding: To develop a dynamic and interactive user interface, bind XAML elements to data sources.

G.	Launching the Program
•	Debugging: To launch your application in debug mode, press F5 or click the Start button in Visual Studio or simply look at step 4 in, “Starting a new WPF Project”.
•	Release: Create your application for production by switching to Release mode.

In summary
A strong platform for creating complex desktop apps is offered by WPF. You may make apps that are responsive and manageable by using the MVVM pattern, XAML for UI design, and a grasp of its structure. To fully utilize WPF's potential, investigate further developed capabilities like data binding, animation, and customized components.
